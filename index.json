[{"content":"\nTimeline for Post-Quantum Migration According to analysis by Chaincode Labs, Bitcoin’s transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) can follow two main strategies: a short-term contingency plan (cf. Figure 1) and a long-term comprehensive path (cf. Figure 2).\nThe short-term strategy focuses on deploying a basic quantum-resistant option within 1 to 2 years, offering a fallback mechanism in case cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) emerge sooner than expected. This involves proposing a minimal PQC signature scheme through a BIP, implementing it in Bitcoin Core, and enabling voluntary migration of vulnerable UTXOs. While not optimized for all use cases, it provides immediate protection for at-risk users and critical institutions. Success depends on close coordination across the technical community and early involvement from major Bitcoin holders.\nThe long-term strategy envisions a broader research and development process to design Bitcoin’s optimal quantum-resistant future. This includes evaluating different PQC algorithms, mitigating their performance trade-offs, and developing robust UTXO migration mechanisms. Drawing from historical upgrades like SegWit and Taproot, which took several years to reach wide adoption, this path could span up to a decade.\nChaincode emphasizes that these two strategies are not mutually exclusive. The short-term plan offers immediate protection and preparedness, while the long-term plan focuses on sustainability, optimization, and ecosystem-wide adoption in the face of evolving quantum threats.\nFigure 1. Timeline of estimate to establish short-term contingency measures.\nFigure 2. Timeline for comprehensive quantum resistance path.\nGovernment Post-Quantum Plans and Timelines Governments worldwide are actively responding to the potential massive disruption posed by quantum computers to existing cryptographic systems by formulating strategies for migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).\nAs of mid-2025, more than 15 countries and regions have issued official guidance on PQC transition. Most follow the NIST (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) standardization process, while some develop indigenous algorithms independently. The general timeline for transition completion spans 2027 to 2035, with 2030 considered a critical milestone.\nUnited States The U.S. has established the most comprehensive plan, including:\nNational Security Memorandum 10 (May 2022): Signed by President Biden, titled “Advancing America’s Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems”.\nThe goal is to mitigate quantum risks as much as possible by 2035.\nNIST Transition Deadlines:\nPhasing out RSA-2048 and ECC-256 by 2030, with complete prohibition by 2035, while allowing hybrid classical-PQC schemes during the transition.\nNSA’s CNSA 2.0 Suite:\nRequires software and network equipment upgrades by 2030, with browsers and operating systems completing upgrades by 2033.\nPresidential Executive Order 14144 (January 2025):\n“Strengthening National Cybersecurity Innovation” emphasizes collaboration with other nations and industry to encourage adoption of NIST’s PQC standards.\nUnited Kingdom The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of GCHQ intelligence agency, published guidance in March 2025 outlining a three-phase transition plan:\nBy 2028: Identify cryptographic services needing upgrades and develop migration plans.\n2028–2031: Prioritize upgrading critical systems and adapt according to PQC progress.\n2031–2035: Complete full migration of systems and products to PQC.\nThe UK plan explicitly bases on NIST standards and aligns with IETF protocol standardization efforts.\nEuropean Union The EU drives its PQC roadmap through the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) working group, established in 2015:\nPublished quantum-safe migration guidelines [ETS20] and key establishment standards [ETS25];\nProvides technical reports endorsing NIST standards as well.\nChina China pursues a more independent and autonomous PQC development path.\nIn February 2025, the Commercial Cryptography Institute launched the “Next Generation Commercial Cryptography Algorithms Program” (NGCC) 1, developing domestic PQC algorithms aligned with national security requirements.\nChina emphasizes technological self-reliance and has not publicly released a detailed transition timeline.\nIndustry Progress in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Several well-known companies relying on cryptography in their products or services have already started migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) solutions.\nCloudflare Date: October 2022\nCloudflare announced that all websites and APIs served through Cloudflare support a post-quantum hybrid key exchange mechanism.\nTechnical Details: This mechanism combines classical elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with the post-quantum Kyber algorithm to form a hybrid scheme.\nSecurity Advantage: Attackers must break both ECC and Kyber algorithms simultaneously to compromise keys, significantly enhancing security.\nGoogle Date: August 2023\nGoogle announced that its Chrome browser started supporting a post-quantum hybrid key generation mechanism similar to Cloudflare’s.\nMotivation and Background: Google emphasized the urgency of updating TLS (Transport Layer Security) to use quantum-resistant session keys to prevent “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” attacks, i.e.,\nAttackers collect encrypted data now and decrypt it later once universal quantum computers become available.\nSignal Date: September 2023\nSignal, a leading privacy-focused encrypted messaging app, announced adding post-quantum security layers to its communication encryption.\nImplementation: Introduced CRYSTALS-Kyber post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) atop its original ECC-based encryption to enhance security.\nApple Date: February 2024\nApple announced a new encryption protocol PQ3 designed for iMessage.\nPQ3 Features:\nUses PQC for initial key agreement and ongoing message exchange;\nSupports automatic recovery mechanisms, enabling rapid restoration of security even if a key is compromised, thereby enhancing overall resilience.\nIndustry Trend Summary With PQC algorithms continuously standardized and maturing, an increasing number of companies will deploy PQC mechanisms, marking a shift from “experimental defense” to “mainstream security requirement.”\nWhy Choose a “Hybrid Encryption” Strategy? No single PQC algorithm is yet proven 100% secure;\nHybrid schemes allow a gradual transition without interrupting existing security guarantees;\nThey prevent a “single point of failure” — even if one algorithm is broken in the future, the other may still provide protection.\nWhy Kyber? Kyber is the first post-quantum key encapsulation algorithm (KEM) standardized by NIST;\nBased on lattice cryptography, currently regarded as highly resilient to quantum attacks;\nHas relatively small key and ciphertext sizes, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications such as TLS and mobile communications.\nDrivers for Industry Action Clear government timelines (e.g., NIST’s 2030/2035 plans) create regulatory pressure;\nQuantum threats may not be immediate, but data harvesting attacks are already ongoing, requiring early preparation to protect future privacy;\nCompanies gain a first-mover advantage in security and can strengthen market trust.\nPhilosophical Debate If a universal, breakable quantum computer eventually becomes reality, the Bitcoin community will face a difficult decision:\nShould it take action to handle currently exposed public-key UTXOs that are vulnerable to quantum attacks?\nThis question fundamentally touches Bitcoin’s core values, such as property rights, censorship resistance, forward compatibility, and conservatism.\nThe “Burn” Position Core Arguments By “burning” quantum-vulnerable UTXOs, these coins become unusable, thereby protecting property rights and network integrity.\nBitcoin developer Jameson Lopp2 , in his article [“Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin” (Lop25a)] and BDML talks, argues:\nAllowing quantum computers to seize these bitcoins results in a wealth transfer—from those who lost keysto winners of the quantum arms race.\nThe “burn” strategy treats quantum vulnerability as a protocol-level bug that should be conservatively fixed, like previous vulnerabilities.\nEconomic Effects “Burning” reduces total Bitcoin supply, thereby increasing the value of remaining coins.\nCoordinated “burn” events can reduce market uncertainty and volatility.\nThe “Steal” Position Core Arguments Opponents of “burning” argue:\nIt violates user property rights and amounts to confiscation.\nBitcoin’s design intent is complete user sovereignty over their assets, allowing spending at any time.\nSome users may be unaware of quantum risks or unable to migrate assets promptly.\nMoral and Technical Dilemmas Protocol changes that render some UTXOs permanently unspendable introduce third-party control, violating Bitcoin’s decentralization principles.\nWithout intervention, the “steal” path becomes the default option—once quantum computers mature, early attackers could seize all vulnerable assets, causing serious wealth redistribution.\nMigration Pathways Overview Migrating Bitcoin to quantum-resistant signatures is one of the most historically significant undertakings in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Even if a quantum-safe signature scheme gains technical consensus and integrates into Bitcoin Core, migrating millions of UTXOs to quantum-safe scripts requires unprecedented network coordination. This section discusses practical migration pathways, on-chain resource requirements, activation methods, user education, and coordination mechanisms3.\nQuantum-resistant migration is not only a technical challenge but also a network-wide collaboration and governance issue.\nIt involves block space, soft forks, user key management, activation mechanisms, and more.\nAll Bitcoin holders need basic awareness of migration pathways to develop effective risk mitigation strategies against quantum threats.\nUTXO Migration As of May 2025, Bitcoin’s UTXO set contains approximately 190 million UTXOs. Only a portion exposes public keys and is thus vulnerable to long-range attacks. However, all UTXOs are potentially susceptible to short-range attacksduring spending and transaction confirmation windows, as described earlier in “On-Spend Vulnerable Script Types.”\nIdeally, all UTXOs should migrate to quantum-resistant scripts by spending old UTXOs in a transaction and creating new UTXOs secured by post-quantum signatures. In practice, some UTXOs are inaccessible (e.g., lost keys), creating the “philosophical dilemma: burn or steal.”\n2024 research estimates:\nTheoretical fastest migration time: Using 100% block space for migration transactions, migrating all UTXOs would take approximately 76–142 days (model-dependent).\nRealistic scenario: Using only 25% block space, it would take 305–568 days.\nIn reality, only an urgent migration of exposed public-key UTXOs is necessary.\nKey points:\nUTXO migration is resource-intensive and costly.\nWithout on-chain scaling, existing block size and block interval severely limit migration throughput.\nSignature aggregation and batching transactions are potential optimizations.\nMigration Mechanisms Several proposed mechanisms balance user participation, consensus rule changes, and technical complexity.\nCommit-Delay-Reveal Protocol (CDR) and Variants Background:\nInitially proposed in 2018, with variants by Adam Back, Tim Ruffing, and others.\nDesigned to securely migrate old UTXOs to post-quantum scripts even after ECC compromise.\nThree-phase process:\nCommit phase:\nUser creates a commitment transaction hashing the old ECC and new post-quantum public keys.\nThe hash is committed on-chain via OP_RETURN.\nTransaction valid under current consensus rules.\nSoft fork needed to enforce that the UTXO can only be spent by knowledge of both private keys.\nDelay phase:\nIntroduces a mandatory delay period (e.g., 6 months) to prevent reorg attacks by ensuring chain finality.\nFunds are locked and unusable during this period.\nReveal phase:\nUser submits a reveal transaction disclosing the original ECC and new post-quantum keys.\nThe transaction is signed with the post-quantum signature.\nVerifies that the reveal matches the commit hash.\nAdvantages:\nHigh security under CRQC presence; allows safe migration of unexposed UTXOs post-ECC compromise.\nSupports migration after quantum attacks occur.\nDisadvantages:\nCannot migrate UTXOs with already exposed public keys (e.g., P2PK).\nRequires user participation in two transactions.\nRequires users to hold post-quantum coins for fees, creating a bootstrapping problem.\nAt least one, more likely two soft forks needed (one for PQ signatures, one for CDR semantics).\nBlock space constraints remain.\nImproved Scheme: Lifted FawkesCoin Protocol Improvements:\nResolves the “user must already hold PQ coins” problem in original CDR.\nEmploys zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) using the PICNIC PQ signature to prove knowledge of a private key without revealing the public key.\nCircumvents the paradox of needing to reveal a public key to commit.\nAdditional capabilities:\nHD wallet users can prove derivation relationships using seeds.\nPartial private key loss is recoverable via master seed.\nCan protect the majority of Bitcoin accumulated since HD wallets became standard.\nCosts and challenges:\nRequires integrating ZKPs into Bitcoin protocol, a more disruptive change than single PQ signature adoption.\nPICNIC and related ZK systems are complex and not yet widely deployed.\nCommentary \u0026amp; Opinion Bitcoin’s quantum-resistant migration is a gradual but urgent process:\nComprehensiveness vs Reality:\nIdeally migrate all UTXOs.\nPractically prioritize active, spendable, high-risk UTXOs.\nInaccessible funds (lost keys) remain a “philosophical problem.”\nTechnical vs Social Coordination:\nTechnical solutions (CDR, ZKP lifting) are early-stage and require extensive validation.\nReal challenges lie in activation, education, consensus coordination, and incentive design.\nFuture research directions:\nDesign quantum-resistant coin creation mechanisms to solve bootstrapping.\nSimplify CDR workflows (e.g., automated wallet support).\nExplore soft-fork-free or incremental transition mechanisms.\nAnalyze Grover’s algorithm effectiveness on various Bitcoin script structures to inform prioritization.\nReferences Institute of Commercial Cryptography Standards, China.

However, the emergence of quantum computers could undermine this assumption within the next decade.\nAt the core of Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundation are:\nthe Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA);\nand, since 2021, the introduction of Schnorr signatures.\nBoth schemes are based on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is asymmetric in nature: deriving the public key from a private key is easy, but reversing the process is believed to require trillions of years even on today’s most powerful supercomputers.\nHowever, in the face of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs), this asymmetry may collapse — deriving the private key from the public key could take only hours or days.\nInstitutions such as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. government, and other international agencies have recommended phasing out elliptic curve cryptography by 2030 and fully deprecating it by 2035.\nPotential Impact of Quantum Computers on Bitcoin Once practical quantum computers become available, their impact on Bitcoin could be profound. According to an analysis by 1:\nApproximately 20% to 50% of all circulating Bitcoin (4 to 10 million BTC) could be at risk of theft;\nThis risk primarily stems from the ability to derive private keys from exposed public keys.\nThe most vulnerable assets include:\nUTXOs that use insecure script types;\nFunds associated with “address reuse”, where the public key has already been revealed;\nExchange and institutional addresses that frequently reuse addresses;\nEarly-era addresses from the Satoshi period, such as those using raw public key scripts;\n“Lost coins”, which remain unmoved and are locked under outdated or unsafe scripts.\nAmong these, high-value exchange and institutional accounts are expected to be top targets for quantum-enabled attackers.\nQuantum Threats to Bitcoin Mining and Ecosystem Security On the other hand, while quantum computing may also impact Bitcoin mining, its threat is considered limited in the foreseeable future:\nCurrent mining performance is primarily driven by clock frequency;\nQuantum miners would have to compete with highly optimized ASIC machines;\nEven with a quadratic speedup from algorithms like Grover’s, it would still be difficult to outperform classical miners;\nThe hardware performance gap remains significant.\nIf quantum miners were to dominate in the future, potential risks could include:\nDouble-spending attacks by small or solo miners;\nIncreased centralization due to disproportionate mining power.\nAlthough these scenarios remain distant, exploring post-quantum mining models still holds theoretical value and can help prepare for long-term contingencies.\nBeyond Signatures and Mining: Ecosystem-Level Risks In addition to the direct threats to digital signatures and mining, a broader set of ecosystem-level vulnerabilities must also be considered in the post-quantum era:\nFor example: SSL/TLS communication protocols, hardware wallets, and firmware update mechanisms may all be compromised by quantum-capable adversaries. Two Types of Quantum Attack Vectors (Long-Range Attack vs. Short-Range Attack)\nLong-Range Attack: Targets addresses whose public keys are already exposed on-chain, such as P2PK, P2MS, and P2TR. These addresses are permanently vulnerable, as their public keys are visible at all times.\nShort-Range Attack: Targets addresses that only reveal their public keys when spending, such as P2PKH. In this case, the attacker must act within a very short window — between the time a transaction is broadcast (and the public key is exposed) and when it gets confirmed on the blockchain.\nIn short, if the public key of a UTXO is known, quantum adversaries may derive the private key and steal the funds. The difference lies in how and when the public key is exposed:\nSome addresses are “natively exposed”, meaning their public keys are visible from the beginning, and thus remain under long-term attack risk.\nOthers (e.g., P2PKH) only reveal the public key when the coin is spent, offering a very narrow attack window, also known as a \u0026ldquo;preemptive\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;racing\u0026rdquo; attack.\nQuantum Vulnerabilities by Script Type The feasibility of quantum attacks depends not only on the existence of CRQCs (Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers), but also on whether the corresponding public key is accessible. Therefore, different script types present different levels of vulnerability. Below is a classification by script type:\n🔴 Immediate Vulnerability P2PK (Pay to Public Key): The earliest script type, which directly exposes the ECDSA public key in the locking script. Though it accounts for only ~0.025% of UTXOs, it secures ~8.68% of all BTC (~1.72 million BTC) — largely associated with early Satoshi-era wallets.\nP2MS (Pay to MultiSig): A script type that exposes multiple public keys. Now rarely used and secures a relatively small amount of BTC.\nP2TR (Pay to Taproot): Despite being a modern script, its key-path spending still reveals a tweaked public key, making it vulnerable to quantum attacks. P2TR makes up ~32.5% of UTXOs but secures only ~0.74% of BTC.\n🟡 On-Spend Vulnerable Script Types P2PK, P2MS, and P2TR are classified as “immediately vulnerable” because they expose public keys directly in the output script (scriptPubKey).\nHowever, some script types do not reveal the public key until the coin is spent. These are vulnerable only during the short window between transaction broadcast and confirmation.\n🟠 Address Reuse Vulnerability Script types such as P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, and P2WSH only expose public keys at the time of spending, meaning the key is normally revealed once.\nBut if the same address (i.e., the same public key) is reused, the associated public key remains permanently exposed on-chain, turning a short-range attack surface into a long-range attack vector.\n🟣 Other Avenues for Public Key Exposure 1. Fork Chain Exposure If a user spends an unspent UTXO on a Bitcoin fork chain (e.g., Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold), the public key becomes exposed on the fork — even though the UTXO remains unspent on the Bitcoin mainnet.\nThus, the corresponding UTXO on the mainnet becomes a long-term quantum target.\n2. Leaked Extended Public Keys (xpubs) xpubs are used in Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, enabling address generation without revealing private keys.\nIf an xpub is leaked, all non-hardened child public keys derived from it can have their private keys recovered by quantum computers.\n3. Public Key Exposure in Multi-Sig \u0026amp; Lightning Network In multi-signature wallets and Lightning Network channels, participants must share their public keys to construct transactions or payment channels.\nAlthough these public keys are not broadly public, they are shared within limited parties, and thus may be exploited by insiders or malicious actors.\nEcosystem Vulnerabilities Once elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is broken by quantum computers, the impact will go far beyond Bitcoin — potentially compromising the entire Internet cryptographic infrastructure.\nCore protocols like SSL/TLS could become insecure, leading to ecosystem-level attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where adversaries intercept and redirect user requests:\nMITM attacks: By compromising SSL/TLS, attackers can forge connections to exchanges and hijack funds.\nHardware wallet updates: Firmware updates may be tampered with, silently embedding backdoors.\nMining pool impersonation: Attackers may masquerade as miners to infiltrate mining pools.\nDNS attacks: Redirecting users to malicious nodes through DNS manipulation.\nAPI attacks: Tampering with third-party APIs widely used by wallets and exchanges.\nThese threats are stealthier than direct cryptographic breakage, potentially remaining undetected for extended periods due to their ecosystem-level obfuscation.\nBitcoin Hash Functions and Grover’s Algorithm Bitcoin relies on two hash functions: SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, used for:\nMining (double SHA-256 on block headers)\nGenerating transaction IDs\nSigning messages\nDeriving addresses from public keys (Hash160)\nQuantum Resistance of Hash Functions The fundamental property of hash functions is irreversibility.\nEven the world’s most powerful supercomputers (e.g., El Capitan, as of Nov 2024) would require far more time to break them than to crack ECC. 2\nGrover’s algorithm offers a quadratic speedup for brute-forcing hash functions:\nClassical attack complexity: O(N)O(N)\nQuantum attack complexity: O(N)O(N​)\nFor example, finding a SHA-256 collision classically requires 22562256 operations.\nWith Grover’s algorithm, this is reduced to 21282128, which is still computationally infeasible without extremely powerful quantum computer.\nImpact on Bitcoin Mining The essence of Bitcoin mining is to find a nonce value that makes the block header\u0026rsquo;s hash lower than the network difficulty target.\nThis process involves repeated SHA-256 computations, currently performed almost exclusively by ASIC hardware.\n1. Limitations of Quantum Mining Grover’s algorithm provides sequential, not parallel, speedup, which leads to key limitations:\nIt cannot scale in parallel like classical mining does; adding more quantum hardware does not linearly increasehash power.\nCompeting with ASICs would require a large number of high-speed quantum machines, making deployment extremely costly.\n2. Network Difficulty Adjustment Bitcoin dynamically adjusts its mining difficulty every 2016 blocks to maintain a block interval of ~10 minutes.\nIf quantum mining is introduced, the protocol will increase the difficulty accordingly, which would further offset any advantage from Grover’s algorithm.\nForks and the 51% Attack 1. Quantum-Induced Forking Risk Research shows that quantum mining could increase the frequency of blockchain forks:\nWhen one miner finds a valid block, other quantum miners must decide whether to continue or restart their computation.\nSimultaneous quantum measurements by multiple miners increase the chance that multiple valid blocks are found at the same time, causing forks.\n2. Security Concerns In a high-fork environment:\nHonest miners\u0026rsquo; hash power gets split across multiple chains;\nAdversaries can concentrate their resources on attacking one chain, potentially gaining dominance without owning 51% of total hash power.\nThis reduces finality and consensus stability, and significantly increases the attack surface.\nComprehensive Quantum Vulnerability Assessment of Bitcoin Component Quantum Threat Resistance Level ECC Signatures Critical risk (Shor\u0026rsquo;s algorithm) Very Low Hash Functions Moderate risk (Grover\u0026rsquo;s algorithm) Relatively High Mining Mechanism Efficiency impacted but adjustable Medium Ecosystem Attacks High risk (SSL, DNS, APIs) Depends on external mitigation Fork Security Potentially severe (more frequent forks) Low References Chaincode Labs.

Quantum computing harnesses the quantum states of microscopic particles—such as photons, electrons, or atoms—to process information. It is fundamentally based on several key principles: superposition, entanglement, coherence, and the no-cloning theorem.\nAs early as 1982, Professor Richard Feynman famously stated:\n\u0026ldquo;Nature isn’t classical, damn it, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical.\u0026rdquo;\nThis insight laid the conceptual foundation for building computational tools using quantum systems themselves, rather than relying on classical approximations of quantum behavior.\nWhy Classical Computers Are Not Enough Many fundamental systems in nature do not follow classical physics but are governed by quantum mechanics. Therefore, if we want to “simulate nature,” classical computation is not sufficient — we must use quantum systems themselves to build computational tools.\nMore specifically, simulating quantum systems with classical computers faces exponential difficulty. A quantum system composed of $n$ particles requires $2^n$ complex numbers to describe its state, which quickly exceeds the processing capability of classical machines. Furthermore, particles in a quantum system are often not independent — they form complex correlations known as quantum entanglement.\nQuantum computing, on the other hand, leverages the superposition of quantum states to perform parallel computation. For example, a 4-qubit quantum register can represent all 16 values from 0 to 15 simultaneously, and any operation on the register acts on all 16 values at once.\nThis is why Feynman proposed a groundbreaking idea: instead of simulating quantum systems with classical computers, we should use quantum systems themselves to compute. His insight was remarkably accurate — as we now know, there are computations that can only be carried out through quantum experiments and are beyond the reach of traditional computers.\nWhat Does Quantum Computing Mean for Mainstream Cryptosystems Like RSA and ECC? In 1994, Peter Shor proposed a quantum algorithm—Shor\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm—that can break mainstream cryptosystems such as RSA and ECC, drawing widespread attention. The foundation of Shor\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm is its ability to perform fast Fourier transforms (FFT) on state vectors of exponential size, making it easier to identify the period of a function.\nQuantum computing leverages the superposition effect of quantum states, allowing parallel computation across all possible states. For example, Schrödinger’s cat can be simultaneously ‘alive’ and ‘dead’—a superposition of two states. If there are 100 cats, each in a superposition of ‘alive’ and ‘dead’ there are ($2^{100}$) possible states. Each state has its own amplitude, positive or negative, and quantum computing can manipulate this exponentially large vector of states simultaneously.\nOn the surface, this exponential parallelism might seem to allow brute-force solutions to any computationally hard problem. However, the output of a quantum computation is itself a superposition, making it difficult to extract a definitive answer.\nCurrently, only Shor’s Algorithm can use quantum Fourier transforms to efficiently extract the period of a function, thereby solving the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems upon which modern public-key cryptosystems RSA and ECC are based. For other hard problems that cannot be reduced to period finding, no polynomial-time quantum algorithms are known yet.\nHow Close Are We to Practical Quantum Computers? Yes and no. To break a 1024-bit RSA key, a universal quantum computer with millions of qubits would be needed—far beyond our current manufacturing capabilities (the largest quantum computers today have only a few hundred qubits):\nIn 2017, IBM introduced the world’s first 16-qubit quantum computer. The latest fault-tolerant universal quantum machines, such as Google’s Willow chip (105 qubits by the end of 2024), now achieve error correction threshold capabilities. The Oxford team has also created single-qubit operations with gate error rates as low as 0.000015%. Developing public-key cryptographic algorithms that can resist quantum attacks (post-quantum cryptography) has become an urgent task. To address this, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project back in 2016. After years of evaluation, the leading quantum-resistant public-key algorithms—such as CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon—are now essentially standardized and are set to become the new benchmarks for federal and enterprise security infrastructure.\nD-Wave’s Progress The Canadian quantum computing company D-Wave has long provided quantum annealers, which are well-suited for solving optimization problems, rather than problems like period-finding as required by Shor’s algorithm.\nIn 2025, D-Wave released its Advantage2 system, featuring over 4,400+ qubits and a 20-node connectivity topology. It is currently offering cloud-based services to clients such as Mastercard, NTT, and the Jülich Supercomputing Centre.\nMeanwhile, D-Wave’s team published a paper in Science claiming “quantum advantage” for the first time: in simulating complex magnetic systems, their machine outperformed the world’s top classical supercomputers by what they claim would be millions of years.\nAlthough this result has sparked debates over classical simulators (such as MPS and t-VMC), it still suggests that quantum annealing is showing practical value in certain scientific and engineering domains.\nD-Wave has built and sold several quantum computers; however, these machines cannot run Shor’s algorithm and therefore do not pose a direct threat to cryptographic schemes based on factoring or discrete logarithms.\nStrictly speaking, D-Wave builds quantum annealers, which are machines that can only run quantum annealing algorithms. Their fundamental working principle differs from that of universal quantum computers, which rely on quantum superposition to achieve powerful computational capabilities. In contrast, quantum annealers rely on quantum tunneling to simulate the annealing process.\nCurrently, there is research underway that attempts to transform integer factorization into an annealing-compatible problem and solve it using D-Wave machines — but so far, it has only managed to factor integers up to 90 bits.\nEmerging Track: Topological Quantum Computing and Fault-Tolerance February 2025: Microsoft launched its first Majorana-based topological quantum processor, Majorana 1, featuring highly stable topological qubits and aiming for million-qubit scalability.\nMay 2025: Quantinuum announced that its H2 system had achieved a record-breaking quantum volume $2^{23}=8388608$, a key metric for assessing a system’s practical computational power.\nMay 2025: Oxford, Google’s Willow, and other teams continued advancing toward fault-tolerant quantum computing by optimizing single-qubit gate fidelities and improving two-qubit error correction schemes.\n","permalink":"https://sidereushu.github.io/posts/notes---what-is-quantum-computing-implications-for-rsa--ecc/","summary":"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-quantum-computing\"\u003e❓What is Quantum Computing?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuantum computing harnesses the quantum states of microscopic particles—such as photons, electrons, or atoms—to process information.
