Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
Post-Quantum Cryptography has become a critical solution to counter the threat posed by scalable, controllable quantum computers to current cryptographic systems.


Urgency of PQC: Originates from Peter Shor’s 1995 algorithm, which can factor integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time, effectively breaking mainstream schemes like RSA, DH, and ECC.


PQC is not a single algorithm, but a set of parallel technical approaches, including:

<p>To address the long-term threat posed by quantum computing to existing cryptographic standards, NIST launched the <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process</strong> in December 2016.  This initiative builds on foundational research from PQCrypto conferences (since 2006) and multiple projects in the EU, Japan (e.g., SAFEcrypto, CREST).</p>
<p>The process is globally open, collecting algorithm submissions, conducting public testing and academic review, with the goal to publish algorithms resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.  As of March 2025, NIST has officially released the following standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FIPS 203</strong>: Encryption algorithm standards (non-signature);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FIPS 204</strong>: <strong>Module Lattice Signature Standard (ML-DSA)</strong> based on <strong>CRYSTALS-Dilithium</strong>;</p>

<p>In addition to the direct threats to <strong>digital signatures</strong> and <strong>mining</strong>, a broader set of <strong>ecosystem-level vulnerabilities</strong> must also be considered in the post-quantum era:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: <strong>SSL/TLS communication protocols</strong>, <strong>hardware wallets</strong>, and <strong>firmware update mechanisms</strong> may all be compromised by quantum-capable adversaries.
<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-types-of-quantum-attack-vectors">Two Types of Quantum Attack Vectors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#two-types-of-quantum-attack-vectors">#</a></h3>
<p>(<strong>Long-Range Attack vs. Short-Range Attack</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-Range Attack</strong>: Targets addresses whose <strong>public keys are already exposed on-chain</strong>, such as P2PK, P2MS, and P2TR. These addresses are <strong>permanently vulnerable</strong>, as their public keys are visible at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short-Range Attack</strong>: Targets addresses that <strong>only reveal their public keys when spending</strong>, such as P2PKH. In this case, the attacker must act within a <strong>very short window</strong> — between the time a transaction is broadcast (and the public key is exposed) and when it gets confirmed on the blockchain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, <strong>if the public key of a UTXO is known</strong>, quantum adversaries may derive the private key and steal the funds. The difference lies in <strong>how and when the public key is exposed</strong>:</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some addresses are <strong>“natively exposed”</strong>, meaning their public keys are visible from the beginning, and thus remain under <strong>long-term attack risk</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others (e.g., P2PKH) <strong>only reveal the public key when the coin is spent</strong>, offering a <strong>very narrow attack window</strong>, also known as a <strong>&ldquo;preemptive&rdquo; or &ldquo;racing&rdquo; attack</strong>.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="quantum-vulnerabilities-by-script-type">Quantum Vulnerabilities by Script Type<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#quantum-vulnerabilities-by-script-type">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The feasibility of quantum attacks depends not only on the existence of CRQCs (Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers), but also on whether the corresponding <strong>public key is accessible</strong>. Therefore, different script types present different levels of vulnerability. Below is a classification by script type:</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="-immediate-vulnerability">🔴 Immediate Vulnerability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-immediate-vulnerability">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>P2PK (Pay to Public Key)</strong>: The earliest script type, which directly exposes the ECDSA public key in the locking script. Though it accounts for only ~0.025% of UTXOs, it secures <strong>~8.68% of all BTC (~1.72 million BTC)</strong> — largely associated with early Satoshi-era wallets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P2MS (Pay to MultiSig)</strong>: A script type that exposes multiple public keys. Now rarely used and secures a relatively small amount of BTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P2TR (Pay to Taproot)</strong>: Despite being a modern script, its <strong>key-path spending still reveals a tweaked public key</strong>, making it vulnerable to quantum attacks. P2TR makes up ~32.5% of UTXOs but secures only ~0.74% of BTC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="-on-spend-vulnerable-script-types">🟡 On-Spend Vulnerable Script Types<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-on-spend-vulnerable-script-types">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>P2PK, P2MS, and P2TR are classified as <strong>“immediately vulnerable”</strong> because they expose public keys directly in the output script (<code>scriptPubKey</code>).<br>
However, some script types <strong>do not reveal the public key until the coin is spent</strong>. These are vulnerable only during the short window <strong>between transaction broadcast and confirmation</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="-address-reuse-vulnerability">🟠 Address Reuse Vulnerability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-address-reuse-vulnerability">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Script types such as <strong>P2PKH</strong>, <strong>P2SH</strong>, <strong>P2WPKH</strong>, and <strong>P2WSH</strong> only expose public keys <strong>at the time of spending</strong>, meaning the key is normally revealed once.<br>
But if the same address (i.e., the same public key) is <strong>reused</strong>, the associated public key remains <strong>permanently exposed</strong> on-chain, turning a <strong>short-range attack</strong> surface into a <strong>long-range attack</strong> vector.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If a user spends an unspent UTXO on a <strong>Bitcoin fork chain</strong> (e.g., Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold), the public key becomes exposed on the fork — even though the UTXO remains unspent on the Bitcoin mainnet.<br>
Thus, the corresponding UTXO on the mainnet becomes a <strong>long-term quantum target</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>xpubs</code> are used in <strong>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets</strong>, enabling address generation without revealing private keys.<br>
If an <code>xpub</code> is leaked, all <strong>non-hardened child public keys</strong> derived from it can have their <strong>private keys recovered</strong> by quantum computers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In <strong>multi-signature wallets</strong> and <strong>Lightning Network</strong> channels, participants must share their public keys to construct transactions or payment channels.<br>
Although these public keys are not broadly public, they are <strong>shared within limited parties</strong>, and thus may be <strong>exploited by insiders or malicious actors</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="ecosystem-vulnerabilities">Ecosystem Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ecosystem-vulnerabilities">#</a></h2>
<p>Once <strong>elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)</strong> is broken by quantum computers, the impact will go far beyond Bitcoin — potentially compromising the <strong>entire Internet cryptographic infrastructure</strong>.<br>
Core protocols like <strong>SSL/TLS</strong> could become insecure, leading to <strong>ecosystem-level attacks</strong> such as <strong>man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks</strong>, where adversaries intercept and redirect user requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MITM attacks</strong>: By compromising SSL/TLS, attackers can forge connections to exchanges and <strong>hijack funds</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware wallet updates</strong>: Firmware updates may be <strong>tampered with</strong>, silently embedding backdoors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mining pool impersonation</strong>: Attackers may <strong>masquerade as miners</strong> to infiltrate mining pools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS attacks</strong>: Redirecting users to <strong>malicious nodes</strong> through DNS manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API attacks</strong>: Tampering with third-party APIs widely used by <strong>wallets and exchanges</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These threats are <strong>stealthier than direct cryptographic breakage</strong>, potentially remaining undetected for extended periods due to their <strong>ecosystem-level obfuscation</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="bitcoin-hash-functions-and-grovers-algorithm">Bitcoin Hash Functions and Grover’s Algorithm<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bitcoin-hash-functions-and-grovers-algorithm">#</a></h2>
<p>Bitcoin relies on two hash functions: <strong>SHA-256</strong> and <strong>RIPEMD-160</strong>, used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mining (double SHA-256 on block headers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating transaction IDs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signing messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deriving addresses from public keys (<code>Hash160</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quantum-resistance-of-hash-functions">Quantum Resistance of Hash Functions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#quantum-resistance-of-hash-functions">#</a></h3>
<p>The fundamental property of hash functions is <strong>irreversibility</strong>.<br>
Even the world’s most powerful supercomputers (e.g., <em>El Capitan</em>, as of Nov 2024) would require far more time to break them than to crack ECC. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Grover’s algorithm</strong> offers a <strong>quadratic speedup</strong> for brute-forcing hash functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classical attack complexity: O(N)O(N)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum attack complexity: O(N)O(N​)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <strong>finding a SHA-256 collision</strong> classically requires 22562256 operations.<br>
With Grover’s algorithm, this is reduced to 21282128, which is still computationally infeasible without <strong>extremely powerful quantum computer</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-bitcoin-mining">Impact on Bitcoin Mining<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#impact-on-bitcoin-mining">#</a></h2>
<p>The essence of Bitcoin mining is to <strong>find a nonce value</strong> that makes the block header&rsquo;s hash lower than the network difficulty target.<br>
This process involves repeated <strong>SHA-256 computations</strong>, currently performed almost exclusively by <strong>ASIC hardware</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1limitations-of-quantum-mining">1. <strong>Limitations of Quantum Mining</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1limitations-of-quantum-mining">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Grover’s algorithm provides sequential, not parallel, speedup</strong>, which leads to key limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It <strong>cannot scale in parallel</strong> like classical mining does; adding more quantum hardware does <strong>not linearly increase</strong>hash power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competing with ASICs would require <strong>a large number of high-speed quantum machines</strong>, making deployment <strong>extremely costly</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-network-difficulty-adjustment">2. Network Difficulty Adjustment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-network-difficulty-adjustment">#</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin dynamically adjusts its mining difficulty <strong>every 2016 blocks</strong> to maintain a block interval of ~10 minutes.<br>
If quantum mining is introduced, the protocol will <strong>increase the difficulty accordingly</strong>, which would further <strong>offset any advantage</strong> from Grover’s algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="forks-and-the-51-attack">Forks and the 51% Attack<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#forks-and-the-51-attack">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="1quantum-induced-forking-risk">1. <strong>Quantum-Induced Forking Risk</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1quantum-induced-forking-risk">#</a></h3>
<p>Research shows that quantum mining could <strong>increase the frequency of blockchain forks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When one miner finds a valid block, other quantum miners must decide whether to <strong>continue or restart their computation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simultaneous quantum measurements</strong> by multiple miners increase the chance that <strong>multiple valid blocks are found at the same time</strong>, causing <strong>forks</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="2security-concerns">2. <strong>Security Concerns</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2security-concerns">#</a></h3>
<p>In a high-fork environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Honest miners&rsquo; hash power gets <strong>split across multiple chains</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adversaries can <strong>concentrate their resources</strong> on attacking one chain, potentially gaining dominance <strong>without owning 51% of total hash power</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduces <strong>finality</strong> and <strong>consensus stability</strong>, and significantly <strong>increases the attack surface</strong>.</p>
