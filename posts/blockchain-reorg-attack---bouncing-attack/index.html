Its core objectives are:\nTo continuously advance Justification and Finalization of the chain when the majority of honest participants are online; To form a probabilistically secure chain selection through honest majority voting when forks exist. However, if an attacker controls:\nClose to 1/3 of the voting power; The ability to delay attestation broadcasts (i.e., temporary network inconsistency); They can create the following situation:\nMake the last justified checkpoint repeatedly switch between two chains, preventing either chain from achieving Finalization.\nThis is known as the Bouncing Attack.\nThe core exploitation points are:\nGasper requires blocks to receive 2/3 votes to be Justified;\nHLMD-GHOST directly prunes branches that conflict with the last Justified Checkpoint;\nIf the attacker can:\nAllow the honest chain to receive 1/3 votes (insufficient for Finalization); Later release votes for their hidden chain to leapfrog Justification; Then they can:\nForce the entire network to “bounce back and forth” between two chains, with neither chain ever accumulating the 2/3 votes needed for finality.\n2. Initial Attack Conditions As shown in the diagram, with cp0 already Justified, two forked chains emerge:\nc1: The main chain being built by honest nodes Its checkpoint is cp1, which will extend to b0 → cp1' → ... c2: The hidden fork maintained by the attacker Its checkpoint is cp2, not yet public, but “justifiable” from the attacker’s perspective Here, “justifiable” means:\nOnce the attacker releases their delayed attestations, cp2 can immediately achieve 2/3 votes and become the new last justified checkpoint.\n3. Attack Process (Unfolding by Epoch) 3.1 Epoch e+1: Honest Nodes Continue Building Chain c1 Honest validators extend on c1:\ncp0 → cp1 → b0 → cp1'\nMeanwhile:\nThe attacker keeps new blocks and votes on c2 from being broadcast, Ensuring cp2 can be Justified at any time, but doesn’t execute it yet. At this point:\ncp1 is the canonical checkpoint in the honest world, cp2 is the “ready to activate” justifiable checkpoint controlled by the attacker. 3.2 Epoch e+2: Honest Chain cp1’ Receives Partial Votes As the epoch progresses:\nThe honest chain cp1' receives over 1/3 attestations, But hasn’t yet received the sufficient 2/3, therefore: cp1' is justifiable but not justified.\nIn other words:\ncp1’ has reached the potential threshold for Finalization, But still requires consensus to progress further. 3.3 Attacker Reveals Hidden Votes, Making cp2 Overtake At this moment, the attacker suddenly:\nReleases all delayed votes for cp2, cp2 immediately receives 2/3 attestations, Thus:\ncp2 becomes the new last justified checkpoint\n4. Gasper’s Chain Pruning Mechanism is Triggered Gasper (specifically HLMD-GHOST) stipulates:\nAll chains that conflict with the latest justified checkpoint must be pruned from the choice tree.\nTherefore:\nc1 conflicts with the newly Justified cp2, c1 is immediately pruned, c2 becomes the new canonical chain, Honest nodes are forced to:\nAbandon the chain c1 they just extended and switch to extending c2.\n5. Attack Continues in a Loop, Achieving “Bouncing” Now the attack state resets to:\nHonest nodes begin continuing to build c2; The honest chain’s new checkpoint (e.g., cp2’) starts accumulating votes; When it reaches 1/3 but is not yet Justified: The attacker can again:\nCreate a justifiable checkpoint on the old chain c1; Withhold votes; Release them at the opportune moment; Make the last justified checkpoint bounce back to cp1'. This repeats:\nThe last justified checkpoint “bounces” between c1 and c2.\nThe final effect:\nNeither chain can accumulate two consecutive 2/3 votes, Therefore: The system cannot achieve Finalization for extended periods → liveness is critically threatened\n6. Necessary Conditions for the Attack In summary, the bouncing attack succeeds based on:\nCondition ①: Attacker possesses at least 1/3 voting power Ensuring:\nCan prevent the honest chain from obtaining 2/3 attestations, Can elevate the hidden chain to 2/3 at any time. Condition ②: Attacker can temporarily control attestation propagation For example:\nThe network is temporarily asynchronous (“can only be launched when the network is temporarily asynchronous”), Causing honest validators to be unaware of the attacker’s hidden votes. Condition ③: Gasper’s fork choice rule must enforce: Conflicting chain pruning (HLMD-GHOST filter) This is the fundamental protocol reason the attack can succeed.\n7. Attack Impact This attack does not:\nEnable double-spending; Rewrite state; Compromise safety. But it can:\nPermanently block Finalization, causing deterministic finality to disappear.\nIn other words:\nThe chain continues running (safety is OK), But from a protocol perspective: The chain remains in a \"suspended, unfinalized\" state, and the value of on-chain certainty collapses.\nFor financial applications, this is a fatal liveness attack.\n8. Can the Attack Continue After GST? The paper points out:\nThe attack launch requires the network to be temporarily asynchronous (before GST), But once successful:\nEven after GST (when the network returns to synchrony), the attack can continue to be maintained.\nThe reason is:\nThe attacker already controls: 1/3 voting power to prevent the honest chain from independently Finalizing; Another chain that can overtake at any time through hidden votes. Therefore, the entire bouncing process no longer requires network anomalies to continue.\n9. Summary The Bouncing Attack is a structural weakness of the Gasper protocol under partially asynchronous network conditions. Its core mechanism lies in:\nThe 2/3 voting requirement for Justification; HLMD-GHOST’s last justified checkpoint pruning rule; The attacker possessing 1/3 voting power and the ability to delay broadcasts. Leveraging these conditions:\nThe attacker can repeatedly make the last Justified Checkpoint switch between two chains, Preventing any single chain from completing two consecutive Justifications, Ultimately causing the system to fail to achieve Finalization, impacting liveness but not compromising safety.

<p>Gasper is the sub-protocol responsible for deterministic finality in Ethereum&rsquo;s PoS consensus. Its core objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To continuously advance <strong>Justification</strong> and <strong>Finalization</strong> of the chain when the majority of honest participants are online;</li>
<li>To form a probabilistically secure chain selection through honest majority voting when forks exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if an attacker controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close to <strong>1/3 of the voting power</strong>;</li>
<li>The ability to <strong>delay attestation broadcasts</strong> (i.e., temporary network inconsistency);</li>
</ul>
<p>They can create the following situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Make the last justified checkpoint repeatedly switch between two chains, preventing either chain from achieving Finalization.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is known as the <strong>Bouncing Attack</strong>.</p>
<p>The core exploitation points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gasper requires blocks to receive <strong>2/3 votes to be Justified</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HLMD-GHOST directly <strong>prunes branches that conflict with the last Justified Checkpoint</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attacker can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the honest chain to receive 1/3 votes (insufficient for Finalization);</li>
<li>Later release votes for their hidden chain to leapfrog Justification;</li>
</ul>
<p>Then they can:</p>

<h1 id="2-initial-attack-conditions">2. Initial Attack Conditions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-initial-attack-conditions">#</a></h1>
<p>As shown in the diagram, with <strong>cp0</strong> already Justified, two forked chains emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>c1</code>: The main chain being built by honest nodes
<ul>
<li>Its checkpoint is <code>cp1</code>, which will extend to <code>b0 → cp1' → ...</code></li>

<li><code>c2</code>: The hidden fork maintained by the attacker
<ul>
<li>Its checkpoint is <code>cp2</code>, not yet public, but &ldquo;justifiable&rdquo; from the attacker&rsquo;s perspective</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <strong>&ldquo;justifiable&rdquo;</strong> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Once the attacker releases their delayed attestations, cp2 can immediately achieve 2/3 votes and become the new last justified checkpoint.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile:</p>

<ul>
<li>The honest chain <code>cp1'</code> receives over <strong>1/3 attestations</strong>,</li>

<p>At this moment, the attacker suddenly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Releases all delayed votes for cp2</strong>,</li>

<p>Gasper (specifically HLMD-GHOST) stipulates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All <strong>chains that conflict with the latest justified checkpoint</strong> must be pruned from the choice tree.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>c1</code> conflicts with the newly Justified <code>cp2</code>,</li>
<li><code>c1</code> is immediately <strong>pruned</strong>,</li>
<li><code>c2</code> becomes the new <strong>canonical chain</strong>,</li>

<p>Now the attack state resets to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honest nodes begin continuing to build c2;</li>
<li>The honest chain&rsquo;s new checkpoint (e.g., cp2&rsquo;) starts accumulating votes;</li>
<li>When it reaches 1/3 but is not yet Justified:</li>

<p>The attacker can again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a justifiable checkpoint on the old chain <code>c1</code>;</li>
<li>Withhold votes;</li>
<li>Release them at the opportune moment;</li>
<li>Make the last justified checkpoint bounce back to <code>cp1'</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This repeats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last justified checkpoint &ldquo;bounces&rdquo; between <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The final effect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neither chain can accumulate two consecutive 2/3 votes</strong>,</li>
<li>Therefore:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>The system cannot achieve Finalization for extended periods → liveness is critically threatened</code></p>

<p>In summary, the bouncing attack succeeds based on:</p>
<h3 id="condition--attacker-possesses-at-least-13-voting-power">Condition ①: Attacker possesses at least 1/3 voting power<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#condition--attacker-possesses-at-least-13-voting-power">#</a></h3>
<p>Ensuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can prevent the honest chain from obtaining 2/3 attestations,</li>
<li>Can elevate the hidden chain to 2/3 at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="condition--attacker-can-temporarily-control-attestation-propagation">Condition ②: Attacker can temporarily control attestation propagation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#condition--attacker-can-temporarily-control-attestation-propagation">#</a></h3>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network is temporarily asynchronous (&ldquo;can only be launched when the network is temporarily asynchronous&rdquo;),</li>
<li>Causing honest validators to be unaware of the attacker&rsquo;s hidden votes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="condition--gaspers-fork-choice-rule-must-enforce">Condition ③: Gasper&rsquo;s fork choice rule must enforce:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#condition--gaspers-fork-choice-rule-must-enforce">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conflicting chain pruning (HLMD-GHOST filter)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the fundamental protocol reason the attack can succeed.</p>

<h1 id="7-attack-impact">7. Attack Impact<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-attack-impact">#</a></h1>
<p>This attack does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable double-spending;</li>
<li>Rewrite state;</li>
<li>Compromise safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it can:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Permanently block Finalization, causing deterministic finality to disappear.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chain continues running (safety is OK),</li>
<li>But from a protocol perspective:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>The chain remains in a &quot;suspended, unfinalized&quot; state, and the value of on-chain certainty collapses.</code></p>
<p>For financial applications, this is a <strong>fatal liveness attack</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="8-can-the-attack-continue-after-gst">8. Can the Attack Continue After GST?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-can-the-attack-continue-after-gst">#</a></h1>
<p>The paper points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attack launch requires the network to be temporarily asynchronous (before GST), But once successful:</p></blockquote>
<p><code>Even after GST (when the network returns to synchrony), the attack can continue to be maintained.</code></p>
<p>The reason is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker already controls:
<ol>
<li>1/3 voting power to prevent the honest chain from independently Finalizing;</li>
<li>Another chain that can overtake at any time through hidden votes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the entire bouncing process no longer requires network anomalies to continue.</p>

<h1 id="9-summary">9. Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-summary">#</a></h1>
<p>The Bouncing Attack is a structural weakness of the Gasper protocol under partially asynchronous network conditions. Its core mechanism lies in:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>2/3 voting requirement</strong> for Justification;</li>
<li>HLMD-GHOST&rsquo;s <strong>last justified checkpoint pruning rule</strong>;</li>
<li>The attacker <strong>possessing 1/3 voting power and the ability to delay broadcasts</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leveraging these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker can repeatedly make the last Justified Checkpoint switch between two chains,</li>
<li>Preventing any single chain from completing two consecutive Justifications,</li>
<li>Ultimately causing the <strong>system to fail to achieve Finalization, impacting liveness but not compromising safety</strong>.</li>
</ul>
